# Model API – Application Overview

This application is part of the **Model API project**, which provides both a backend and a frontend already configured and running in a simple yet robust way.  
The main idea behind the project is to offer a reusable base that can be downloaded and extended to build new applications without starting from scratch.

The **frontend** was developed using **React**, and the **backend** was built with **Spring Framework** and **Java 21**.

The application uses **PostgreSQL** for data persistence, running inside a **Docker container**.  
It also includes both **development** and **production** profiles for flexible environment configuration.
